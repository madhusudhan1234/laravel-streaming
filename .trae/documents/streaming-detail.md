ðŸŽ§ Audio Streaming Feature â€” Technical Specification
1. Overview

This feature enables progressive audio streaming, allowing users to play audio instantly without downloading the full file.
The server sends audio data in chunks, supporting seek, pause, resume, and efficient playback even on slow connections.

Weâ€™ll use:

Laravel for backend streaming (via HTTP range requests)

Vue.js for frontend player UI

Optional: TailwindCSS for styling

2. What is Audio Streaming

Streaming is the process where:

The audio file is sent in parts (bytes) as it plays.

The browser requests only a portion of the file at a time using a header like:

Range: bytes=0-


The server responds with only that segment using:

HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/5023489


âœ… This allows:

Instant playback (no waiting for full download)

Jumping to specific parts (seek)

Lower memory and bandwidth usage
